Dramatic 1960s-inspired editorial portrait. A woman with voluminous blonde hair styled in a retro bouffant sits inside a sleek black vintage car, framed by a rain-streaked window. She wears a sophisticated black halter dress, revealing her bare shoulders, with dark smoky eye makeup and nude lips. Her intense gaze is framed by a thick black headband, enhancing the vintage aesthetic. The dimly lit interior contrasts with the glowing streetlights outside, creating a cinematic, noir-inspired atmosphere. Raindrops on the window add texture and depth, reinforcing the mysterious, high-fashion feel.
