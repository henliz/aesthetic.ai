Soft, dreamy fashion editorial set in a lush garden. A young woman sits on a heart-shaped pink vintage chair, surrounded by overgrown greenery and delicate wildflowers. She wears a pastel yellow babydoll dress with a delicate lace hem, paired with transparent green platform heels. Her expression is playful yet serene, resting her chin on her hands with her elbows on her knees, gazing directly into the camera. Her long, tousled blonde waves add a whimsical, romantic touch. Sunlight filters through the trees, creating a soft, natural glow. The overall aesthetic is ethereal and fairy-tale-like, blending vintage charm with modern femininity.
