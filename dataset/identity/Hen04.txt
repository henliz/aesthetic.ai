A sunlit close-up with golden light catching the natural highlights in her dark blonde hair, making it appear almost honey-toned. The hair is cut in a soft, layered bob, slightly longer at the front, with delicate framing around her face. Loose strands add a casual, effortless feel. Her green eyes, framed by light lashes and softly arched brows, hold a neutral expression with a subtle pout. Shadows from the car window create contrast, emphasizing her bone structure and natural skin texture.
