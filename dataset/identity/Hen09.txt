A dimly lit indoor setting with warm, soft lighting that casts a cozy glow on the face. The golden-blonde hair appears slightly darker due to the lighting, with natural waves framing the face. The fringe is slightly tousled, blending seamlessly with the layered cut that falls just past the jawline. The expression is subdued, with a subtle pout and lips slightly pursed, conveying a neutral but slightly playful mood. The eyes are softly focused, with a faint reflection of light catching in them, adding depth. Shadows add contrast, emphasizing the contours of the cheeks and jawline. The overall atmosphere is intimate, with the warm lighting enhancing the soft, natural texture of the hair.
