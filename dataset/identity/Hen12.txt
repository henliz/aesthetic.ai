A slightly tousled dark blonde bob with soft, flicked-out ends, falling just past the chin. The layers create a natural, effortless movement, and the hair has a smooth, slightly glossy texture. Wispy bangs blend seamlessly with the rest of the hair, lightly brushing against the forehead. The eyes are a striking green, framed by soft, well-defined brows. The expression is calm, with a subtle, closed-lip smile. Lighting is natural, providing a soft, even glow across the face.
