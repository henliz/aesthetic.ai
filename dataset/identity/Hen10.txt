A relaxed close-up taken in a dimly lit room, with soft shadows adding warmth and depth. The golden-blonde hair appears slightly lighter due to subtle lighting shifts, with natural waves creating movement around the face. The fringe is slightly parted, blending into the layered cut that frames the cheekbones. The expression is open and confident, with lips slightly parted and a faint natural sheen. The gaze is direct but relaxed, with light catching in the irises, giving a soft glow. Shadows from the lighting emphasize the natural contours of the face, bringing attention to the smooth complexion.
